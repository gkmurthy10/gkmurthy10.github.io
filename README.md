### RESEARCH PROJECTS
**Nationwide Survey on the Implications of Autonomous Vehicles in the United States**	   	   Spring 2017 – Present  
Supervisor: Dr. Kara Kockelman (Sponsored by TxDOT)					                      UT Austin
A survey with around 70 questions was created to address various issues regarding autonomous vehicles. The main topics targeted in this survey were privacy, security and ethics and questions regarding dynamic ride-sharing. 2,588 respondents were acquired using a panel of Americans by Survey Sampling International.

**Analyzing the Dynamic Ride-Sharing Potential for Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleets Using Cellphone Data from Orlando, Florida** Spring 2017 – Present  
Supervisor: Dr. Kara Kockelman (Sponsored by TxDOT)					                      UT Austin  
Cellphone data obtained for Orlando was spatially and temporally disaggregated to have a resolution of one minute and intersection-level detail. Disaggregated data was used to assess the dynamic ride-sharing potential for the region by comparing origin-destination versus en route dynamic ride-sharing. A simulation of a fleet of autonomous vehicles was used to estimate optimal fleet sizes for the region.  

**Agent-Based Microsimulations of Shared Autonomous Vehicles in Austin using Dynamic Ride-Sharing on MATSim**      Fall 2016 – Present   
Supervisor: Dr. Kara Kockelman (Sponsored by TxDOT)					                      UT Austin  
MATSim (Multi-agent Transport Simulation), an agent-based simulation model was studied to include shared autonomous vehicle simulations. Tolling and AVs were incorporated into an existing SAV module. Several scenarios are being run. Dynamic ride-sharing will be added in the coming months.  

**Estimating a Car-Following Model Based on Spring-Mass-Damper Dynamics using NGSIM Data**	          Fall 2017  
Supervisor: Dr. Christian Claudel (In a graduate course: CE 391F)					         UT Austin  
An open-source dataset for vehicle trajectories by NGSIM has been used to develop a microscopic car-following model. Model formulation was carried out based on an existing Spring-Mass-Damper based dynamics with certain alterations. Then, data fitting was carried out using non-linear optimization in MATLAB.  

**Evaluating Traffic Characteristics by Mining IMU Data: An Exploratory Study**			      Spring 2017  
Supervisor: Dr. Christian Claudel (In a graduate course: CE 397)					         UT Austin  
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) fitted with a GPS device was used to collect 3-4 hours’ worth of data over a period of 7 days. Data was cleaned and processed to ensure segmented continuity and an unsupervised machine learning model was applied. The predictive power of certain pitch and acceleration variables from the IMU was high. The project concluded that better data collection efforts and data tagging can ensure high prediction of traffic characteristics using an IMU.  

**Travel Demand Modeling using TransCAD**			 			                                     Fall 2016  
Supervisor: Dr. Kara Kockelman (In a graduate course: CE 391H)		                                                 UT Austin  
CAMPO Data was used to carry out Travel Demand Modeling in the 6-county region of Austin. Various scenarios were developed and their feasibility was tested. Increasing parking costs in the Central Business District was concluded as a viable scenario to mitigate congestions.  

**A Path-Based Incentive Approach to Achieving System Optimum**		                                     	          Fall 2016  
Supervisor: Dr. Stephen Boyles (In a graduate course: CE 392C)			                                    UT Austin  
A mathematical model with equilibrium constraints was developed to achieve system optimum. Budgeted allocation of path-based incentives was analyzed. Significant reductions in travel times based on economic use of funds was the typical end product.  

**Framework for Various Traffic Models under Mixed Traffic Conditions**                    Fall 2015 – Spring 2016  
Supervisors: Dr. Gowri Asaithambi & Dr. Tom V Mathew                      			       NITK & IIT Bombay  
Previous simulation models under mixed traffic conditions were studied to identify important parameters affecting similar conditions. Models for pedestrian crossing, uncontrolled intersections were formulated and executed.  

**Quantitative Determination of Vehicle Influence in Mixed Traffic Conditions**              Fall 2015  
Supervisor: Dr. Gowri Asaithambi 	 	 	 	 	 	                                                        NITK   
Open access mixed traffic trajectory data collected in Chennai, India was used in this project. Vehicle type dependency and factors affecting the influence was analyzed. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the effect of influential parameters.  

**Modeling Mid-Block Sections under Mixed Traffic Conditions** 	 	                                          Summer 2015
Supervisor: Dr. Tom V Mathew	        			                             			       IIT Bombay
The traffic model was theorized based on spring-mass-damper dynamics for integrated movement. Microscopic model for a single vehicle was implemented in Excel and then extrapolated as a Simulator using MATLAB. Extensive test cases were conducted to verify the robustness of the model.
